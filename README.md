# pypura

Python package for interacting with Pura smart fragrance diffusers

## Support Me

I'm not employed by Pura, and provide this library purely for your own enjoyment and home automation needs.

If you don't already own a Pura diffuser, please consider using [my referal code (s3zjukz)](http://rwrd.io/s3zjukz) to get $6 off your first order of $50+ (as well as a tip to me in appreciation)!

If you already own a Pura diffuser and still want to donate, consider buying me a coffee ‚òï (or beer üç∫) instead by using the link below or [sponsor me on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/natekspencer):
